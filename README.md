# CSS Country Flags

CSS Country Flags is a delightful project that aims to bring the flags of the world to life using nothing but HTML and CSS. Whether you're a vexillology enthusiast like [Sheldon Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper) or a web development hobbyist, this project offers an exciting opportunity to explore the unique designs of various national flags.

Starting with the Singapore flag in honor of Singapore National Day, this project will expand to include flags from different countries, each carefully crafted with simple code.

## üåè Flags Collection

Here's a list of flags currently available:

### üá∏üá¨ Singapore

The Singapore flag consists of two equal horizontal sections, red above white. A white crescent moon occupies the upper left red section. Next to the moon are five white stars arranged in a circle.
Each feature of the Flag bears a unique symbolic meaning. Red stands for universal brotherhood and equality of man. White symbolizes pervading and everlasting purity and virtue. The crescent moon represents a young nation on the ascendant, and the five stars depict Singapore's ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice, and equality.

### CSS Version

Simply include the specific CSS file for the flag you wish to use and refer to the corresponding HTML structure.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/css/sg.css">
<div class="flags singapore">
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>
```

This CSS version is great for learning and understanding CSS better. Please note that this CSS version is **NOT** recommended for actual web implementations due to potential compatibility and computational issues.
