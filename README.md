# CSS Country Flags

CSS Country Flags is a delightful project that aims to bring the flags of the world to life using nothing but HTML and CSS. Whether you're a vexillology enthusiast or a web development hobbyist, this project offers an exciting opportunity to explore the unique designs of various national flags.

Starting with the Singapore flag in honor of Singapore National Day, this project will expand to include flags from different countries, each carefully crafted with simple code.
